# What is this?
This just contains updated versions of the winter event.  
For the rest of the files download from:

### MAKE SURE TO REMOVE THIS IN Tools\avMethods.py
```
print(reset_match())
```
# Recent updates

### Fixed stop/start key not stopping

### Full numbis support + auto start
```python
AUTO_START = True # if true upon failure it will auto restart, this also starts the macro when you launch the script
USE_NIMBUS = True # Use the nimbus cloud instead of newsman (more consistent + better)
```

### Added loop-wide lost detection
Restarts program upon lost + resets the mount too. MAKE SURE TO ADD NEW PICTURE IN ``RESOURCES\WINTER!``

```python
detect_loss() # detects + restarts 
reset_mount() # resets the mount state to unmounted
```

# Common Fixes

Mega downloads can occasionally corrupt files, which breaks either **Python** or **Tesseract.**

### Tesseract issues

If Tesseract stops working or the macro can’t detect text:

    Re‑download the files and unzip again, or

    Install a clean version of Tesseract from:
    https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/5.5.0

    Clear the old Tesseract folder before installing

    Optionally add the Tesseract directory (not the exe) to your system PATH

### Python issues

If Python fails to run or packages are missing:

    Install a clean Python 3.13.11

    Install the required packages listed here:
