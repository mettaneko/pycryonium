# Recent updates

### Fixed stop/start key not stopping

### Full numbis support + auto start
```python
AUTO_START = True # if true upon failure it will auto restart, this also starts the macro when you launch the script
USE_NIMBUS = True # Use the nimbus cloud instead of newsman (more consistent + better)
```

### Added loop-wide lost detection
Restarts program upon lost + resets the mount too. MAKE SURE TO ADD NEW PICTURE IN ``RESOURCES\WINTER!``

```python
detect_loss() # detects + restarts 
reset_mount() # resets the mount state to unmounted
```
